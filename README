Name: atoi.rb
 Converts an ASCII string representing of a number ('256') into an integer (256). It 
accomplishes this task successfully without the use of a single condition statment in the
primary function, nor is multiplication utilized in the conversation. Instead the 
primary function relies on a indexed array (Hash) and division in order accomplish the 
conversion.

Usage:
	./atoi.rb -s '[STRING_REPESENTATION_OF_AN_INTEGER]' 
			e.g. ./atoi.rb '745'
				=> 745

More details on usage be attained by executing atoi.rb with the -h hook
	e.g. ./atoi.rb -h
	
Note:
	The initial interpretation directory contain the code I wrote based on my initial 
interpretation of the problem. I initial thought the input should be an ASCII
representation of a number such as "54 52 50" which would produce an output of 642.
